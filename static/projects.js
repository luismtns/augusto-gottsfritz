    content: `<p>As fundamental constants go, the speed of light,&nbsp;<em>c</em>, enjoys all the fame, yet&nbsp;<em>c</em>&rsquo;s numerical value says nothing about nature; it differs depending on whether it&rsquo;s measured in meters per second or miles per hour. The fine-structure constant, by contrast, has no dimensions or units. It&rsquo;s a pure number that shapes the universe to an astonishing degree &mdash; &ldquo;a magic number that comes to us with no understanding,&rdquo; as Richard Feynman described it. Paul Dirac considered the origin of the number &ldquo;the most fundamental unsolved problem of physics.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>Numerically, the fine-structure constant, denoted by the Greek letter &alpha; (alpha), comes very close to the ratio 1/137. It commonly appears in formulas governing light and matter. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s like in architecture, there&rsquo;s the golden ratio,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://www.colorado.edu/physics/eric-cornell" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Eric Cornell</a>, a Nobel Prize-winning physicist at the University of Colorado, Boulder and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. &ldquo;In the physics of low-energy matter &mdash; atoms, molecules, chemistry, biology &mdash; there&rsquo;s always a ratio&rdquo; of bigger things to smaller things, he said. &ldquo;Those ratios tend to be powers of the fine-structure constant.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p>The constant is everywhere because it characterizes the strength of the electromagnetic force affecting charged particles such as electrons and protons. &ldquo;In our everyday world, everything is either gravity or electromagnetism. And that&rsquo;s why alpha is so important,&rdquo; said&nbsp;<a href="https://physics.berkeley.edu/people/faculty/holger-muller" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Holger M&uuml;ller</a>, a physicist at the University of California, Berkeley. Because 1/137 is small, electromagnetism is weak; as a consequence, charged particles form airy atoms whose electrons orbit at a distance and easily hop away, enabling chemical bonds. On the other hand, the constant is also just big enough: Physicists have argued that if it were something like 1/138, stars would not be able to create carbon, and life as we know it wouldn&rsquo;t exist.</p>
    
    <hr />
    <h2><strong>Physicists have more or less given up on a century-old obsession over where alpha&rsquo;s particular value comes from; they now acknowledge that the fundamental constants could be random, decided in cosmic dice rolls during the universe&rsquo;s birth. But a new goal has taken over.</strong></h2>
    
    <p>Look at this image caption.&nbsp;<strong>Look</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>Physicists want to measure the fine-structure constant as precisely as possible. Because it&rsquo;s so ubiquitous, measuring it precisely allows them to test their theory of the interrelationships between elementary particles &mdash; the majestic set of equations known as the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-new-map-of-the-standard-model-of-particle-physics-20201022/">Standard Model of particle physics</a>. Any discrepancy between ultra-precise measurements of related quantities could point to novel particles or effects not accounted for by the standard equations. Cornell calls these kinds of precision measurements a third way of experimentally discovering the fundamental workings of the universe, along with particle colliders and telescopes.</p>
    
    <p>With a margin of error of just 81 parts per trillion, the new measurement is nearly three times more precise than the&nbsp;<a href="https://science.sciencemag.org/content/360/6385/191" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">previous best measurement</a>&nbsp;in 2018 by M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s group at Berkeley, the main competition. (Guellati-Kh&eacute;lifa made the most precise measurement before M&uuml;ller&rsquo;s in 2011.) M&uuml;ller said of his rival&rsquo;s new measurement of alpha, &ldquo;A factor of three is a big deal. Let&rsquo;s not be shy about calling this a big accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
    
    <p><strong>Guellati-Kh&eacute;lifa</strong>&nbsp;has been improving her experiment for the past 22 years. She gauges the fine-structure constant by measuring how strongly rubidium atoms recoil when they absorb a photon. (M&uuml;ller does the same with cesium atoms.) The recoil velocity reveals how heavy rubidium atoms are &mdash; the hardest factor to gauge in a simple formula for the fine-structure constant. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s always the least accurate measurement that&rsquo;s the bottleneck, so any improvement in that leads to an improvement in the fine-structure constant,&rdquo; M&uuml;ller explained.</p>

    <h3>Aubrey de Grey has been called many things. &ldquo;Transhumanist&rdquo; is one of them, but one he dislikes. &ldquo;Immortalist&rdquo; is the tag used to describe him and his colleague Bill Andrews in a documentary shown at South by Southwest this March, though de Grey rolls his eyes when someone drops the word &ldquo;immortality.&rdquo;</h3>
    <p>The British gerontologist considers himself a &ldquo;simple medical researcher,&rdquo; but his research is about fiddling with cells to stop ageing in human beings, and potentially postponing death indefinitely. If it&rsquo;s not immortality (in de Grey&rsquo;s world, you could still be dispatched by an infectious disease or a shotgun), it&rsquo;s quite a close beast.</p>
    <p>He believes that tackling the individual illnesses that haunt old people&rsquo;s lives is a fundamentally flawed strategy; the right course of action is to act at the cellular level to prevent ageing from setting off those illnesses in the first place. His Silicon Valley-based foundation-cum-laboratory, the SENS Research Foundation, is completely devoted to this feat.</p>
    <p>In the past, de Grey&rsquo;s views were often met with skepticism or hostility, when not openly guffawed at. That has not completely changed, but the idea that ageing should actually be regarded as a disease, and that it might even be treated as such, is increasingly gaining ground. Recently, that&rsquo;s been given a boost by research into tackling ageing on a genetic level.</p>
    <p>I wanted to ask de Grey how things are going at the frontline of the anti-ageing battle, so we exchanged some emails (he doesn&rsquo;t carry phones, &ldquo;ghastly, horrible things that deprive people of essential solitude&rdquo;), and we finally met in Cambridge last week.</p>
    <p>Drinking a pint of ale and tormenting his greying Old Testament-style beard, he initiated me in the science and doctrine of which he&rsquo;s the standard-bearer, most of which can be summarized in one question: If we could really wipe old age and death off the planet, why shouldn&rsquo;t we?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">First of all, let&rsquo;s look at some recent news. A couple of weeks ago, scientists at Harvard linked the circulatory system of a young mouse to that of an older mouse. The result was that some tissues of the old mouse were rejuvenated. What&rsquo;s the significance of that?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">It&rsquo;s very important. This whole idea of linking two animals of different ages&mdash;it&rsquo;s called heterochronic parabiosis&mdash;to study ageing has been around for a little while now. At SENS, we work very closely with some of the guys who did that at Harvard. Of course, we&rsquo;re not going to do the same thing to people.</p>
    <p>In general, the experiment has led to a very useful discovery: There&rsquo;s a particular protein in the bloodstream of young individuals, called GDF11, that helps to reactivate certain aspects of cell division in certain parts of the brain. Now, that&rsquo;s only a small piece of information; there&rsquo;s lot more that is not yet known. But I expect that, within the next five years, at least another half a dozen similar rejuvenating factors will be discovered.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So is this mice thing the first step to defeat ageing?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">I don&rsquo;t want to quite say that. All we know is that GDF11 can stimulate certain types of cells to divide when they would not previously divide due to old age. Now, cell division is not the whole story of ageing. In fact, sometimes it can be a bad thing to make cells divide more often, because they may be more exposed to cancer. But still, it&rsquo;s a whole new tool, and it&rsquo;s very important.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Do you think that people may be starting to think that ageing is the real enemy?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">I do think so, yes. The things that I&rsquo;ve been saying for years are finally beginning to get understood. People are understanding that diseases of old age are not really diseases: They are aspects of ageing, side effects of being alive. If you want to cure them, what you&rsquo;ll have to cure is to be alive in the first place&mdash;but you can&rsquo;t actually do it. So we&rsquo;ll have to take a preventative maintenance approach. That means that we&rsquo;ll have to identify the various types of molecular and cellular damage that the body does to itself as a side effect of its normal metabolic operation. Once you&rsquo;ve identified them, which has already been done, you have to find a way to repair that damage and prevent it from developing into a pathology of old age. That&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m working on.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">What are you really trying to achieve? Longevity or immortality?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">Well, first of all, any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don&rsquo;t work on longevity, I work on health. And it just happens that, historically, the main thing that kills people is&hellip;not being healthy. So healthier people will likely live longer.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It&rsquo;s taken; it&rsquo;s a religious word.&rdquo;</h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p>How much longer? It depends on how much longer we can keep people healthy. The best we can say at the moment is that the human body is a machine. Therefore, it ought to be the case that we can have the same kind of impact on the human body that we already have now on simple manmade machines, like cars. So, as I said, we can rely on preventative maintenance: repairing any damage before it makes the doors fall off. It seems to work really well with cars; we&rsquo;ve got one-hundred-year-old cars around now. So, if you do sufficient maintenance, the sky&rsquo;s the limit. We should be able to maintain the human body in good health indefinitely, however long we like.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">So&hellip;it&rsquo;s immortality, right?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">Don&rsquo;t use the word immortality when you talk about my work. It&rsquo;s taken; it&rsquo;s a religious word. Immortality means zero risk of death from any cause, but I don&rsquo;t work on stopping people from being hit by trucks. I work on keeping them healthy.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">By the way, what&rsquo;s your relationship with religion?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">I personally have no religious views, but I have sometimes been attacked by religious people, who said that I was playing God. But it&rsquo;s quite interesting that it&rsquo;s really easy to get people coming from a religious background to understand that it would be a sin not to work on this. That&rsquo;s because ageing causes a lot of suffering, and alleviating suffering is something the scriptures told was our duty. I had some success with that argument.</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Ok, what about the social and political consequences of this potentially indefinite extension of life you&rsquo;re aiming at bringing about?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">I&rsquo;ve addressed this issue once or twice, and I noticed that the mistake that people always make is that they think I&rsquo;m saying we would live much longer in a context where nothing else changes. They think like, &ldquo;The rest of the world will be just like now but everybody will be biologically 25 forever.&rdquo; That&rsquo;s obviously complete nonsense. If we just look at the mathematics, before we&rsquo;ll have anybody living until the age of 200, a lot of things will have happened, and changed. For example, people always panic about paying pensions to people that live longer. But why would you need a pension if you&rsquo;re healthy? Even the very concept of work won&rsquo;t exist in the same way, because we&rsquo;ll probably have more and more automation. Look, we have at least one hundred years before we&rsquo;ll have any 200-year-old people.</p>
    <p>But we should probably start planning everything in advance. Right now, nobody is going to behave as if it&rsquo;s going to happen. If you actually managed to do it, one day, society would be completely off-guard.<br />That&rsquo;s true, but I am not going to tackle each individual problem&mdash;pensions, kids, resources&mdash;that might arise in a post-ageing society. I prefer to help people focus on the fact that we&rsquo;ve a problem today, a really rather bad problem. That is that 100,000 people every fucking day are dying of ageing. That&rsquo;s the important thing, not worrying about hypothetical problems.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately, people are programmed to find reasons why it would be a bad idea to defeat ageing. This is mainly because they fear the unknown, since the world would be very different without ageing.</p>
    <blockquote>
    <h3>&ldquo;Any longevity benefit that I may achieve would be a side effect. I don&rsquo;t work on longevity, I work on health.&rdquo;</h3>
    </blockquote>
    <p class="ktt-interview-question font-weight-700">Aren&rsquo;t you afraid that living for, say, one thousand years, may be boring?</p>
    <p class="ktt-interview-answer">I find this a very sad question. Of all the ridiculous questions I get about defeating ageing, this is the saddest. Anyone who asks that question must have such a miserable life.</p>`,
